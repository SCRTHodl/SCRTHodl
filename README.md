- 👋 Hi, I’m @SCRTHodl
- ## Overview

This account is used for work related to governance, safety, and execution integrity in computational systems.

Repositories published here focus on conceptual research, normative specifications, and infrastructure oriented experimentation. The emphasis is on correctness, accountability, and disciplined execution rather than product marketing or speculative development.

## Scope of Work

Work published under this account may include:

- Governance and authority models for execution and system change
- Normative specifications and invariants
- Defensive publications and prior art disclosures
- Infrastructure and platform level research
- Supporting materials for production systems under development

## What This Account Is Not

This account is not used for:

- Gaming or entertainment projects
- Token or protocol promotion
- Financial speculation
- Tutorial content or implementation guides
- Marketing driven repositories

Any conceptual materials published here are intentionally non implementational unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Publication Intent

Some repositories under this account exist solely to establish public disclosure of general principles. Others may support active development work. Each repository clearly states its intent, scope, and license.

Nothing published here should be interpreted as production ready code unless explicitly documented as such.

## Contact

For professional or research related inquiries, contact details are provided within individual repositories where appropriate.
